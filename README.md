# force-directed-layout
A basic force directed layout graph in WPF.

Not much to say on this, it was one of those side projects where I saw something and thought "that's interesting, i wonder if i could do that". I had no real need for it so it remains unfinished, I did the interesting bits and moved on to something else.

If I was going to revisit it, I would remove WPF as a presentation medium and redo in HTML canvas - more importantly I would abstract the presentation from the objects. I daresay some work is needed on constraining the forces etc.
